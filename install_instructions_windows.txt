NOTE: I did not have a windows machine to try this on, so it may or may not work. No git install instructions included

1) Install python3.4: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/ (it comes with pip!)

2) Open a shell window


[note: it's possible you'll want "pip" instead of "pip3" for all of the following]
3) Install virtualenv
	pip3 install virtualenv

4) Create a virtual environment (this will prevent anything you install from messing with anything else you currently have installed)
    virtualenv venv

5) Activate your virtual environment
        source venv/bin/activate
 
6) Install pandas
	pip3 install pandas

7) Install scikit-learn
	pip3 install scikit-learn

8) Install scipy
	pip3 install scipy
